## FUNCTIONAL WORKSHOP PIKACHU

The idea of this workshop is to learn the basics of Functional programming using JavaScript with Ramda.

#### The steps are:
- Install: `npm install`
- Write in **human language** a *"how-to-solve"* each problem
- Run tests: `npm test`
- Implement your solution as it would be a regular TDD kata
- Read `examples/` and try to apply to your code.
- Refactor using: Pure functions, Curry, Compose/Pipe, and other Ramda helpers.
- Once you feel that you refactor enough, you could check if the human language that you write before is more similar to after the refactor or before.
- When you finish, you could check the `solution/` folder and compare with my solution.
- If you have any suggestion, you could open a PR and change my solution or add any test case.

#### Next steps:
  I want to create a second level of this kata.
  Will consist on make the pokemons fight agains each other and try who lives or who dies (similar to game of life).
