### FUNCTIONAL WORKSHOP PIKACHU

The idea of this workshop is to learn the basics of Functional programming using JavaScript with Ramda.

The steps are:
- Write in a human language a how-to solve each problem
- Implement your solution as it would be a regular TDD kata
- Read `examples/` and try to apply to your code.
- Refactor using: Pure functions, Curry, Compose/Pipe, and other Ramda helpers.
- When you finish, you could check the `solution/` folder and compare with my solution.
- If you have any suggestion, you could open a PR and change my solution or add any test case.
